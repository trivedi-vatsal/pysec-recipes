# Getting Started with the Security Recipe

Welcome to the **Python Security Audit Recipe**! This guide provides an overview of automated security scanning and helps you understand what this recipe will do for your Python project.

## What You'll Achieve

The Python Security Audit Recipe transforms your repository into a security-first codebase by providing:

- ✅ **Automated security scanning** running weekly on schedule
- ✅ **Intelligent GitHub issues** automatically created for vulnerabilities  
- ✅ **Rich audit reports** in JSON, Markdown, and text formats
- ✅ **Zero-maintenance security** that works automatically in the background

## How It Works

The recipe works through three main components:

1. **📋 GitHub Actions Workflow** - Runs pip-audit scans automatically
2. **🎫 Issue Templates** - Creates structured vulnerability reports  
3. **🔍 Automated Management** - Updates and closes issues as vulnerabilities are resolved

### The Process

    D --> F[Track & Update]
    E --> G[Auto-close]
```

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- ✅ **GitHub repository** with a Python project
- ✅ **`requirements.txt` file** in your repository root
- ✅ **GitHub Actions enabled** in your repository
- ✅ **Repository write access** to create workflows and issues
